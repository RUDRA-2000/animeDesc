    <h2 style="margin: 20px 40px;">Authority</h2>
    <h4 style="margin: 20px 40px;">As the leader of Toman, Mikey has absolute control over its members. His presence is able to strengthen the entire gang as a whole, amplifying everyone's strength, making Toman an incredibly formidable and dangerous opponent for enemies.</h4>
    <h2 style="margin: 20px 40px;">Fighting Powers</h2>
    <h4 style="margin: 20px 40px;">Mikey is regarded as the strongest member Toman and arguably the series from a fighting standpoint. His epithet, the Invincible Mikey, is indicative of his strength and how he is revered among other delinquent groups. He is strong enough to incapacitate other elite gang members with a single kick, and his enemies often remark that they cannot believe that he is a mere teenager.</h4>
    <h2 style="margin: 20px 40px;">Martial Arts</h2>
    <h4 style="margin: 20px 40px;">His signature and finishing move is a high right roundhouse kick that is executed at a blinding speed to the opponent's temple, which has caught all but the strongest opponents off guard. It hooks the opponent's head and slams it into the ground. Almost all who are hit by this kick get knocked out instantly. This kick has also been seen done using Mikey's left leg.</h4>
    <h2 style="margin: 20px 40px;">Endurance</h2>

    <h2 style="margin: 20px 40px;">Decision Making</h2>
    <h4 style="margin: 20px 40px;">Mikey has a rather unique and fairly keen sense of intuition that manifests in differing somewhat supernatural ways. Upon his first encounter with Takemichi, he was somehow able to tell that he was not a normal middle schooler, although he couldn't fully understand the true extent of Takemichi's nature, and remained somewhat suspicious about who and what he was, due to being capable of somewhat predict future events. </h4>
    <h2 style="margin: 20px 40px;">Friendship</h2>
    <h4 style="margin: 20px 40px;">Mikey is blessed with unparalleled charisma, something noted by both insiders and rival delinquents, which allows him to maintain his crew in line and garner the respect of other gang leaders. This charisma is, however, a double-edged sword, as while he has the potential to rally and lead the entire delinquent world under his banner, this power can easily become distorted and incredibly destructive. </h4>
